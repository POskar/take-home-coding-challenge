IOS take home coding challenge guidelines
===============================================

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were
going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g.
Github, Bitbucket...).


Challenge Description
---------------------

Create a catalog front that allows user to search and list products
 
* First page is a list of specific number of products ex. 4 or 6, and load more by scrolling.
* User can filter by category to see products within it.
* User can filter using price range, specific color and product rating.
* User can combine two or more filters.
* User can add product to the cart.
* Cart count must be updated by adding products to the cart.

Mockup notes:

* Category filter should list all categories in a drop down list.
* Sort by filter, for data sorting.
* Filter button should open the filter by page.



Technical spec
--------------
* All data can be created and hardcoded into the application. No need to connect to APIs etc. if you want to skip this. There is not a need for a large number of data, just enough to test the application. Make sure to make this clear in code and in your readme.
* Swift and Auto Layout constrains are preferred.

How will we review?
